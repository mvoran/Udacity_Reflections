Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A: Adding a remote repository allows for (1) public access to work, (2) sharing/distributing work with colleagues without the need
to ship files around, (3) self-sharing of work across devices.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: Since the GitHub version of the repository is more widely shared users might want to keep current work product private until a set of changes that should be shared more widely is complete.

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A: A clone is a copy of a repository (usually local-->GitHub or GitHub-->local). A fork is a GitHub-->GitHub clone. A branch is a variation of a repository, often used to store alternate versions of a repository (like language-specific versions) or new/experimental features that have not been approved for production.

Q: What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

A: The benefit is that the user has access to the remote version of the repository without requiring internet access. In addition, the user can review the contents of the remote repository and resolve conflicts before any merge of the remote to the local copy.

Q: How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

A: Lots of small, informal collaborative work could easily happen outside of GitHub. Where GitHub shines is in managing complex work with lots of contributors. The biggest downside to using GitHub is the learning curve to master the git commands.

Q: When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

A: If there is good coordination/separation between the contributors, and the user is convinced that the changes will not break master it should be OK to make changes in master. However, if coordination/approval is necessary, or if it is not possible to guarantee that the changes would not break master the user should create a separate branch to track the work.
